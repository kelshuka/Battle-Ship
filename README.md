# Battle-Ship
## The Odin Project - Battleship
This is an implementation of the battleship game. There are 4 ships in each board.

**Future work to include**

1) Allow player to place the ships in desired locations (can also be by drag   and drop method).
2) Create a 2-player option that allows the players take turns by passing the laptop back and forth in such a way that players do not see each other's boards.
